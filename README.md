# Direct Input

This plugin enables Unreal Engine handle input from Direct Input devices, such as racing wheels, and send Force Feedback to them.

The code is ported from an old (non-Unrea) project to Unreal Engine and is made open source so that the code hopefully can be improved.

Known issues:

- Currently only enumerate devices meant for driving (by design).
